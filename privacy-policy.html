        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We <strong>do not share, sell, rent, or trade</strong> any user information with third parties because we do not collect any personal data.

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Since all your data (favorites, settings, search history) is stored locally on your device using iOS's secure storage mechanisms:</p>

            <li>Only you have access to your app data through your device</li>
            <li>If you delete the app, all local data is removed from your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. Since we do not collect any personal data at all, the App is safe for users of all ages. However, please note that third-party advertisements from Google AdMob are displayed, which are subject to Google's policies regarding age-appropriate advertising.</p>

        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect or transmit any user data, there are no international data transfers. However, Google AdMob may transfer data internationally as described in their privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Regarding the data stored locally on your device, you have full control:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is accessible within the app</li>
            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can delete favorite words within the app, or delete all data by uninstalling the app</li>

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the App after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>10. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>Our App does not contain links to external websites or services. All functionality is contained within the app itself.</p>

        <h2>11. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
        <p>We <strong>do not use</strong> any analytics services or tracking tools. We do not track how you use the app, which words you search for, or any other usage patterns. The only tracking that occurs is through Google AdMob for advertising purposes, as described in Section 2.</p>

        <h2>12. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        <p>For California residents: Since we do not collect any personal information, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provisions regarding data access, deletion, and sale do not apply. However, you have the right to control advertising tracking as described in Section 2.3.</p>

        <h2>13. European Privacy Rights (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA): Since we do not collect or process any personal data, GDPR obligations regarding data processing do not apply to our direct operations. However, Google AdMob's data processing may be subject to GDPR, and you can exercise your rights through Google's privacy controls.</p>
